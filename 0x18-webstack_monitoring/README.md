# Web Stack Monitoring Readme

## Introduction
This document outlines the importance of web stack monitoring, its main areas, principles, and essential components. Additionally, it provides an overview of access logs, error logs for a web server like Nginx, and discusses the four golden signals of monitoring. Furthermore, it includes examples of commands for monitoring a web server running on Ubuntu 14.04 with Nginx as the web server and a Python backend.

## Why is Monitoring Needed?
Monitoring is essential for maintaining the health, performance, and security of web applications. It helps in detecting and resolving issues proactively, ensuring optimal user experience and minimizing downtime. By monitoring various metrics, administrators can identify trends, predict potential problems, and make informed decisions to optimize resource utilization and improve system reliability.

## Main Areas of Monitoring
The two main areas of monitoring are:
1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: This involves monitoring the underlying infrastructure components such as servers, networks, databases, and storage systems.
2. **Application Monitoring**: This focuses on monitoring the performance, availability, and behavior of the application itself, including application servers, web servers, databases, and other software components.

## Principles of Monitoring
Some key principles of monitoring include:
- **Proactivity**: Anticipating and resolving issues before they impact users or services.
- **Granularity**: Monitoring at a granular level to capture detailed insights into system behavior.
- **Automation**: Automating monitoring processes to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency.
- **Alerting**: Setting up alerts to notify administrators of critical issues or deviations from expected behavior.
- **Historical Analysis**: Analyzing historical data to identify trends and patterns, enabling better decision-making and capacity planning.

## Access Logs for a Web Server (such as Nginx)
Access logs record all requests made to the web server, including details such as the IP address of the client, timestamp, requested URL, response status code, and user-agent. These logs provide valuable insights into website traffic, popular pages, and potential security threats.

## Error Logs for a Web Server (such as Nginx)
Error logs capture information about errors encountered by the web server while processing requests. This includes errors such as 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, and others. Error logs are crucial for troubleshooting issues, identifying bugs, and maintaining the stability and security of the web server.

## The Four Golden Signals of Monitoring
The four golden signals of monitoring, as coined by Google SRE (Site Reliability Engineering), are:
1. **Latency**: The time taken to serve a request. High latency can indicate performance issues.
2. **Traffic**: The amount of incoming traffic to the system. Sudden spikes or drops in traffic may require attention.
3. **Errors**: The rate of requests that result in errors. Monitoring errors helps identify and resolve issues impacting user experience.
4. **Saturation**: The utilization of resources such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc. High saturation levels may lead to performance degradation or system failure.

## Examples of Monitoring Commands
Here are some examples of commands for monitoring a web server on Ubuntu 14.04 with Nginx and a Python backend:

1. Check Nginx status:
   ```
   sudo service nginx status
   ```

2. View Nginx access logs:
   ```
   tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
   ```

3. View Nginx error logs:
   ```
   tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

4. Monitor CPU and memory usage:
   ```
   top
   ```

5. Monitor disk usage:
   ```
   df -h
   ```

6. Monitor network traffic:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install iftop
   sudo iftop
   ```

7. Monitor Python processes:
   ```
   ps aux | grep python
   ```

These commands provide real-time insights into the performance and health of the web server and underlying infrastructure.

## Conclusion
Effective monitoring is essential for ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of web applications. By monitoring key metrics, analyzing logs, and employing best practices, administrators can detect issues early, optimize resource usage, and provide a seamless user experience.
