# Bash Processes & Signals

## PID (Process ID)

In Bash, a Process ID (PID) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each running process on a Unix-like operating system. PIDs are crucial for managing and interacting with processes.

## Process

A process in Bash refers to the execution of a program or command. Each process has its own PID, and processes run independently, isolated from each other.

## Finding a Process's PID

To find a process's PID, you can use commands like `ps` or `pgrep`. For example, to find the PID of a process named "example_process," you can use:

```bash
ps aux | grep example_process
```

or

```bash
pgrep example_process
```

## Killing a Process

To terminate a process, you can use the `kill` command followed by the process's PID. For instance, to kill a process with PID 1234, you would run:

```bash
kill 1234
```

If a process is unresponsive, you can forcefully terminate it using:

```bash
kill -9 1234
```

## Signal

In Bash, a signal is a software interrupt delivered to a process to notify it to perform a specific action. Signals can be generated by the kernel, other processes, or the process itself.

## Unignorable Signals

There are two signals that cannot be ignored:

1. **SIGKILL (9):** This signal forces the process to terminate immediately. It cannot be caught or ignored, making it a powerful but drastic way to stop a process.

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

2. **SIGSTOP (19) or SIGTSTP (20):** These signals pause a process, and unlike most signals, they cannot be caught or ignored. To resume a stopped process, you can use SIGCONT (18).

```bash
kill -STOP <PID>
```

These unignorable signals are powerful tools for process management but should be used judiciously to avoid data corruption or other unexpected consequences.

# Bash Process Management Commands

This README provides an overview of essential Bash commands for process management.

## ps - Process Status

The `ps` command displays information about active processes. It provides a snapshot of the current system state.

### Usage:

```bash
ps aux
```

This command lists detailed information about all running processes.

## pgrep - Process Grep

The `pgrep` command searches for processes based on their names and other attributes.

### Usage:

```bash
pgrep process_name
```

This command returns the PID of processes matching the specified name.

## pkill - Process Kill

The `pkill` command sends signals to processes based on their names.

### Usage:

```bash
pkill -SIGTERM process_name
```

This command terminates processes that match the specified name.

## kill - Terminate or Signal Processes

The `kill` command is used to terminate or send signals to processes.

### Normal Termination:

```bash
kill PID
```

### Forced Termination:

```bash
kill -9 PID
```

This command terminates processes based on their PIDs.

## exit - Exit the Shell

The `exit` command is used to exit the current shell or script.

### Usage:

```bash
exit
```

This command terminates the shell session or script execution.

## trap - Set Signal Traps

The `trap` command allows you to define actions to be taken when signals are received.

### Usage:

```bash
trap 'echo "Signal received"' SIGINT
```

This example prints a message when the interrupt signal (SIGINT) is received.

## Caution

Exercise caution when using commands that terminate processes, especially with signals like SIGKILL (`kill -9`). Forced terminations can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.

Refer to the respective man pages (`man ps`, `man pgrep`, `man pkill`, `man kill`, `man exit`, `man trap`) for more details and options. Understanding these commands is crucial for effective process management and system administration.
