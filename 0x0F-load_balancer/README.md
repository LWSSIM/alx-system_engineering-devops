# Project README: Introduction to Load Balancing with HAProxy (RedRobin)

Welcome to the Load Balancing project using HAProxy (RedRobin)! This project aims to provide you with hands-on experience and understanding of load balancing techniques, specifically utilizing HAProxy alongside NGINX on Debian/Ubuntu systems. Through this project, you will delve into the world of load balancing, web stack debugging, and gain familiarity with essential concepts such as HTTP headers.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will explore the following key topics:

1. **Load Balancer**: Understanding the role and importance of load balancers in distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers efficiently.

2. **Web Stack Debugging**: Identifying and resolving common issues that may arise within a web stack, ensuring the smooth operation of the system.

3. **Introduction to Load-Balancing and HAProxy**: Learning about load balancing principles and the HAProxy software, which is a reliable and widely-used solution for load balancing.

4. **HTTP Header**: Exploring the HTTP header and its significance in the communication between clients and servers, including how it can be manipulated for load balancing purposes.

5. **Debian/Ubuntu HAProxy Packages**: Installing, configuring, and managing HAProxy packages on Debian/Ubuntu systems, focusing on achieving high availability and efficient load balancing.

## Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of load balancing and its importance in distributed systems.

## Useful Commands
Here's a list of useful commands to help you navigate through the configuration and management of HAProxy and NGINX:

1. **Install HAProxy**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install haproxy
   ```

2. **Install NGINX**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

3. **Start/Stop/Restart HAProxy**:
   ```
   sudo service haproxy start
   sudo service haproxy stop
   sudo service haproxy restart
   ```

4. **Start/Stop/Restart NGINX**:
   ```
   sudo service nginx start
   sudo service nginx stop
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```

5. **Check HAProxy Configuration**:
   ```
   sudo haproxy -c -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
   ```

6. **Check NGINX Configuration**:
   ```
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

7. **View HAProxy Logs**:
   ```
   sudo tail -f /var/log/haproxy.log
   ```

8. **View NGINX Logs**:
   ```
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```
